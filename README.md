This model is developed with the aim of building a generalized computational model that can correlate the chemistry, intercritical annealing schedule, ferrite-martensite volume fractions and mechanical properties of dual phase steel. A dataset has been prepared by considered some existing publications. Using this dataset, we have built two chain regressive models. The results obtained are promising indicating a generalized model that can work on any duap phase steel chemistry.
