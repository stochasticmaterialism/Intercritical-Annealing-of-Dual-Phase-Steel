This model is developed with the aim of building a generalized computational model that can correlate the chemistry, intercritical annealing schedule, ferrite-martensite volume fractions and mechanical properties of dual phase steel. A dataset has been prepared by considered some existing publications. Random forest regressor has been trained snd tested in this work. Using this dataset, we have built two chain regressive models. The results obtained are promising indicating a generalized model that can work on any dual phase steel chemistry.
